T20I match analysis and an algorithm for team calssification and optimal line up generation

To get started you will need to addtionally obtain the data from cricsheet (manually or with the automated download script found in this folder). The different jupyter notebooks provide aspects into various aspects of the league and its players. The model trainer and statsmodel files contain the modelling appraoch. To work with them it is necessary to firtst preprocess the data with the data preprocessin script (be carful to change the given paths accordingly to the league). The segmented monte carlo files implement the monte carlo simulation needed to obtain game estimates and expected runs as well as eveluate batting orders.
